# Documentation to use the Shiny App
## This app predict the value of the mpg from the mtcars dataset

- This file will teach you how to use the Shiny application deployed on RPubs. The main objective is to predict the Miles/(US) gallon (mpg) from the data set mtcars. 

- A simple linear regression was performed taking into account the variables: 
  - Weight (1000 lbs)
  - Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
  - Gross horsepower
  
- The Linear model employed in this work is:
  -Linear.Model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + am + hp, data = mtcars )
  
- The board consists in three options:
  - HP
  - WT
  - Transmission type

- The range of the variables vary from: 
  - 1 to 100 for the HP varaible;
  - 0 to 15 to WT variable; 
  - For the trasmission type there are two categories to be selected: Automatic or Manual.

- The final result is composed by a bar plot generated by the package **ggplot2**.
  - The blue bar represents the predict value of the *mpg* variable.
  - The green bar represents the HP variable.
  - The red bar represents the WT varibale.
